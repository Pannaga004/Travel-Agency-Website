# Travel-Agency-Website
I developed a basic travel agency website using HTML and internal CSS. Key features include a Home Page highlighting offers, a Testimonials Page showcasing customer reviews, a Popular Destinations Page with inspiring travel locations, and a Travel Packages Page detailing itineraries and pricing. The site is user-friendly and visually appealing.
